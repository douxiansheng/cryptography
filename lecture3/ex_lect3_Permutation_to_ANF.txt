Write a MAGMA code for a function that given randomly a permutation F of the vector space (GF(2))^4, it returns the ANF of F.

Notes:
1. To generate randomly a permutation F of (GF(2))^4:
   i) define the set V:={v:v in VectorSpace(GF(2),4)}
   ii) define F:=Random(Sym(V)), where Sym(V) is the set of all permutations of V

2. In MAGMA, the image of an element v in V by F is defined by v^F

3. Solution(A, w) : ModMatRngElt, ModTupRng -> ModTupRngElt, ModTupRng

    Given a matrix A belonging to M_n(R) and a vector w belonging to the
    tuple module R^n, solve the system of linear equations 
    v * A =w.  
    The function returns two values:
    A particular solution v;
    The kernel K of A so that (v + k) * A = w for k in K.
